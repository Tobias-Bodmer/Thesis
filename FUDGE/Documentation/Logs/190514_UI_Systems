- Reviewed UIGenerator Experiment
- There should be a clearer seperation between CSS and Typescript Code 
  -> UIGenerator should not manipulate Style 
  -> Use classes for changing style of Objects.
- Enums should turn into dropdown menues during UI Generation
  -> Use MutatorTypes to build structure, fill later
