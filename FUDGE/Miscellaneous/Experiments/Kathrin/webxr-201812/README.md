## WebXR Working Application

Used an older version of WebXR (Dec 18) - did not get it to work with newer versions :(

Only working with following dependencies:

-   Chrome Canary version 71.0.3578.5 (should work with most between 70 and 72 but not sure...)
-   Setting chrome://flags #webxr and #webxr-hit-test enabled
-   Using ARCore supported Phone Version 8.0 or later - full list (here)[https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices]
-   ARCore installed
