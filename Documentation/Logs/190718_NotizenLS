The clickdummy for the usertest was presented by Lea Stegk and Monika Galkewitsch. Takeaways:
- FUDGE will not run inside the browser, only the finished product. 
- We need to create a splashscreen with generic menu bar (should it change with the different editors? -> NO! stays the same)
- Make editors accessible through new menu bar item "Editor" instead of listing them in the "window" entry.
- Editors need their own window, it shouldnÂ´t be replaced on change but added so multiple ones can be viewed side by side.

Scene editor: blue circle of rotate gizmo needs to be wider 
Text sizes need adjusting to Menu bar text 
use grid layout css eg. for fieldsets and their labels
place "Add Node" button in Scene explorer 

Viewport: Option to show/hide gizmos (lights, cameras etc.)
Replace Rotation Gizmo with normal translation gizmo with sphere in center to signify rotation tool; scale and translation tools also get their own symbol in the center.

Inspector: v in foldable menu needs to be replaced with triangle and placed before component
the name of the script should be displayed in place of the title "script". Each script gets its own component
In the beginning there are no components, need to be added by user via "Add Component" button (like Unity)
"Assets" will be renamed to "Resource"

Animation editor: Autokey feature does not need to be implemented at this point, low priority
inspector and timeline too big, half size and use new free space for preview viewport

Sketch editor: delete Rotation/Scale property in inspector
rename "layer" property to "order"
implement rulers that measure in px (standard origin at middle, x left negative, y upper half negative, origin shape: +)
